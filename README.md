This is my first notebook on Kaggle, trying out the spaceship titanic dataset. Got a pretty nice test accuracy score (80%) with XGBoost and manual hyperparameter tuning, the model with automated hyperparameter tuning has a higher training accuracy score but a slightly lower test accuracy score (79%).
